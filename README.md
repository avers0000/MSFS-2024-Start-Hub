# MSFS 2024 Start Hub

**MSFS 2024 Start Hub** is a lightweight launcher that automatically starts Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 along with any required utilities, tools, and scripts. It streamlines pre‑flight preparation and removes the need to manually launch multiple applications every time.

## 📂 Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11  
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 installed

---

## 📝 Known Limitations

- MSFS startup time varies significantly depending on system performance; if the simulator takes longer to appear, the launch timeout can be adjusted in the configuration file  
- When MSFS performs an update before launching, the simulator process may not appear for an extended period; increasing the timeout may help, although it is not recommended since such cases are rare  
- Some antivirus software may warn about launching scripts (BAT, CMD, PS1)
- When both MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024 are installed, the launcher may detect the wrong version; this will be fixed in the next update
